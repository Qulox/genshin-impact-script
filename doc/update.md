**Attention: You are required to reset your configuration file as a disruptive modification has been implemented in this version.**

The previous months have witnessed a series of significant occurrences. From the imposition of a citywide lockdown in Shanghai, to the comprehensive lifting of epidemic prevention measures in China, to the considerable downsizing in the IT industry... a plethora of events have hindered the progress of updating the script. At present, the amount of time I can allocate to the project each week is significantly less than before, which has resulted in a delay in updating the script.

Regrettably, the following modules will be temporarily disabled in this update: Tactic, Skill Timer, and Controller. Nonetheless, these modules will be gradually reinstated in future versions.

On a slightly more favorable note, the project has undergone a substantial overhaul, commencing with the compiler and addressing various significant and minor issues. The outcome is a more efficient and stable system, which will be beneficial for future maintenance.

Considering the magnitude of this update, a detailed explanation of each modification will not be provided. However, if you have any inquiries or suggestions, please do not hesitate to inform me.

Wishing you all a delightful experience in Teyvat in the days ahead.
